# Analysis of the Influence of Affective Ratings for English Vocabulary Items on the Lexical Retrieval in Chinese
Data-driven research aiming at finding out retrieval time of lexical items in Chinese, which was shown by Tsang (2018) to be influenced by the complexity of characters, is additionally influenced by affective ratings as compiled by Mohammad (2018) for English vocabulary items.

This project is an adaptation of a project done by me as an assignment for the Data Science for Linguists advanced seminar taught in the Winter Semester 2024/25 by dr Johannes Dellert at the University of TÃ¼bingen.
